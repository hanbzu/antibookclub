# Anti Book Club

## Context

We want to find people to a book with in a sync book club.

## Forces that make demands on the form

1 “Social contact and a common schedule will make me more likely to dedicate time to this book”
2 “By exchanging ideas or trying to explain my understanding I’ll be more likely to make real use of the material in my mind”
3 “I already know people who I’d enjoy doing this with”
4 “I don’t want to commit to maintaining a list in yet another app. Ideally this is a one stop thing for me”
5 “I’d like to know when there’s quorum to start reading a book”
6 “It’s okay, I can organise the meetings by myself, but I need to know who wants to read this book”
7 “I’d like to know what this person I barely know now is wanting to read”

## Resolve related forces into diagrams

1 Add book I want to read
2 See if there's books where I can start a club
3 Contact the people to start the club on a book

## Place the built form into context and look for misfits
